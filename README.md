iota is a set of small JavaScript modules designed for speed, extendibility and modular applications development. Compatible with Nodejs, RequireJS and jQuery.

iota is the smallest letter in the Greek alphabet and so it reflects the main idea of this collection of modules. Each file should be as small as it is possible.
